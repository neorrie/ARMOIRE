## WAD2 G9T5 PROJECT - ARMOIRE

ARMOIRE is a digital wardrobe for fashion enthusiasts to catalog curated outfits and to take control of their clothing. In addition, it acts as a fashion platform for individuals to seek out advice from their peers with the aim of bettering fashion decision.

## Motivation

People particular about fashion are facing lengthy decision making that stems from having too many permutations of outfits combinations in real time. Moreover, seeking fashion advice from like-minded peers is becoming increasingly disorganized due to the growing number of social media platforms. ARMOIRE addresses these challenges by providing users with a centralized platform to catalog their wardrobe and easily create outfit polls to share with friends. This streamlines the decision-making process and fosters more focused and meaningful fashion discussions within their social circles.
